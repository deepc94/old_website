**Hello!** I am a second year MS/Ph.D. student at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/){:target="\_blank"} specializing in Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Speech Processing. Currently, I'm working with [Dr. Madalina Fiterau](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfiterau/){:target="\_blank"} on improving object detection in thermal images. Last summer, I was a Research Intern at [Signify Research](https://www.signify.com/en-us){:target="\_blank"} (formerly Philips Lighting) working on automatic speech emotion recognition/conversion and audio event detection using deep learning. 
Previously, I worked with [Dr. Erik Learned-Miller](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/){:target="\_blank"} on improving object detection in images using unsupervised hard example mining from videos. Before grad school, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Seagate Technology](https://www.seagate.com/).

In my free time, I love to cook gourmet dishes (especially those by Gordon Ramsay), and listen to classic rock music (I'm a big fan of Queen). To know more about me, look at some of the [projects](/projects) I've done, or [papers](/publications) I've published. For more details, take a look at my [Résumé](/assets/docs/Deep_Chakraborty_Resume.pdf).
