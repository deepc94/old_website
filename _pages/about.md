**Hi there!** I am a third year MS/Ph.D. student at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/){:target="\_blank"} specializing in deep Learning, computer vision and speech processing. Currently, I'm working with [Erik Learned-Miller](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/){:target="\_blank"} and [Madalina Fiterau](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfiterau/){:target="\_blank"} on improving object detection by incorporating "visual common sense" using self-supervision.

In the past I have worked on applying deep learning to audio processing tasks such as emotion conversion and speaker/event identification as a research intern at [Signify Research](https://www.signify.com/en-us){:target="\_blank"} (formerly Philips Lighting) and at the [Indian Institute of Technology at Mandi](http://iitmandi.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}. I also worked as a software engineer at [Seagate Technology](https://www.seagate.com/){:target="\_blank"} prior to grad school. I got my bachelor's degree in [Electronics & Communication engineering](https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/department-list/electronics-communication-engineering.html){:target="\_blank"} from [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://manipal.edu/mit.html){:target="\_blank"} in India.

In my free time, I love to cook gourmet dishes (especially those by Gordon Ramsay), play the guitar and listen to classic rock music (I'm a big fan of Queen). To know more about me, look at some of the [projects](/projects) I've done, or [papers](/publications) I've published. For more details, take a look at my [CV](/assets/docs/Deep_Chakraborty_CV.pdf).
